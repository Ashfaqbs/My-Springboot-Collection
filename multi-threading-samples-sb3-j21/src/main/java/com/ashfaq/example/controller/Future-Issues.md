The use of `Future.get()` in the code **introduces blocking**, which can effectively make our parallel tasks sequential, especially during the result collection phase.

Here's a breakdown:

### **Understanding Futures:**
- `executor.submit()` starts each task asynchronously, which means they can run in parallel.
- However, when we call `future.get()`, it **blocks** until the corresponding task is complete. This blocking happens for each future, so it waits for one task to finish before proceeding to the next `future.get()`.

This means that although we're submitting multiple tasks for parallel execution, the code will still wait for each task sequentially when calling `future.get()`, leading to a loss of the parallel benefit during result collection.

### **Why is it Blocking?**
- `future.get()` waits for the task associated with that `Future` to complete before returning a result.
- While waiting for each task to finish one by one, the blocking nature can cause the overall execution time to be similar to sequential processing.

### **How to Fix:**

If the goal is to wait for all tasks to finish **without blocking** one by one, we can:
1. **Use `invokeAll`:** This method submits a batch of tasks and waits for **all of them** to complete before proceeding.
2. **Use `CompletableFuture`:** This is a more modern and non-blocking approach introduced in Java 8. It allows asynchronous execution and result collection without blocking.

#### **1. Using `invokeAll`:**

`invokeAll()` will wait for all tasks to complete and collect results simultaneously, thus avoiding blocking on individual tasks:

```java
List<Callable<Product>> tasks = new ArrayList<>();
for (Product product : products) {
    tasks.add(() -> {
        // Logic for each product update
        // Similar logic as we have in your code
        return updatedProduct; // Return updated product
    });
}

// This will submit all tasks and wait for all of them to complete
List<Future<Product>> futures = executor.invokeAll(tasks);

// Collect results after all tasks are done
for (Future<Product> future : futures) {
    try {
        Product updatedProduct = future.get(); // No blocking on each task individually
        if (updatedProduct != null) {
            updatedProducts.add(updatedProduct);
        }
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // Handle exceptions for each task
    }
}
```

#### **2. Using `CompletableFuture`:**

With `CompletableFuture`, we can chain tasks and collect results without blocking:

```java
List<CompletableFuture<Product>> futures = products.stream()
    .map(product -> CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
        // Logic for each product update, same as before
        return updatedProduct; // Return updated product
    }, executor)) // Runs asynchronously
    .collect(Collectors.toList());

// Combine all futures and wait for all tasks to complete
List<Product> updatedProducts = futures.stream()
    .map(CompletableFuture::join) // Waits for each task but doesn't block sequentially
    .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

### **Summary:**
- **Yes,** calling `future.get()` in a loop causes **sequential blocking**, even though tasks are submitted in parallel.
- To avoid this, use alternatives like `invokeAll()` or `CompletableFuture` to manage asynchronous tasks and results more efficiently.




The **blocking vs non-blocking** part and how it relates to `Future` and `CompletableFuture`,the implementation examples for both approaches using the first function.

### **Blocking vs Non-Blocking Explained:**

- **Blocking:**
  When we call `Future.get()`, it *blocks* the thread until the result is available. This means the thread will be idle, waiting for the task to complete before it proceeds to the next one. This is why `Future` can make things sequential if used improperly — while tasks might be executed concurrently, the result collection happens in a blocking way.

- **Non-Blocking:**
  With `CompletableFuture`, when we call `thenApply()` or `thenAccept()`, it doesn't block the current thread. Instead, it attaches a callback function that will execute **only** when the result is available. This makes the whole operation non-blocking, allowing the program to continue running other tasks while the background task is processing.

### **1. Future-based Implementation (Blocking)**

```java
public List<Boolean> updateProductsWithFuture(List<Product> products) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException {
    ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5); // Create a thread pool
    List<Future<Boolean>> futures = new ArrayList<>(); // To collect the futures
    
    // For each product, submit the task to update
    for (Product product : products) {
        Future<Boolean> future = executor.submit(() -> updateProductWithValidation(product));
        futures.add(future); // Add future to the list
    }

    // Collect the results in a blocking way
    List<Boolean> results = new ArrayList<>();
    for (Future<Boolean> future : futures) {
        Boolean result = future.get(); // This will block until the result is available
        results.add(result); // Collect the result
    }

    executor.shutdown(); // Shutdown the executor
    return results; // Return the list of boolean results (true/false for each update)
}
```

### **Explanation:**
- Here, we are submitting tasks to an executor that runs in parallel.
- But when we call `future.get()`, it blocks the execution until the result is available. Even if the tasks are running concurrently, the collection of results becomes **sequential** because each `.get()` is a blocking call.

### **Blocking Behavior:**
- Let’s say we have 20 products. Even though all 20 tasks may be submitted in parallel, the **result collection** will wait for each task to complete, one after the other.

---

### **2. CompletableFuture-based Implementation (Non-blocking)**

```java
public CompletableFuture<List<Boolean>> updateProductsWithCompletableFuture(List<Product> products) {
    List<CompletableFuture<Boolean>> futures = products.stream()
            .map(product -> CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> updateProductWithValidation(product)))
            .collect(Collectors.toList());

    // Non-blocking way to collect the results
    return CompletableFuture.allOf(futures.toArray(new CompletableFuture[0]))
            .thenApply(v -> futures.stream()
                    .map(CompletableFuture::join) // Join is non-blocking
                    .collect(Collectors.toList())
            );
}
```

### **Explanation:**
- We are using `CompletableFuture.supplyAsync()` to submit the tasks asynchronously.
- `CompletableFuture.allOf()` is a non-blocking way to wait for all the tasks to complete.
- Unlike `future.get()`, which is blocking, `CompletableFuture.join()` is non-blocking because it attaches the collection of results to a callback that runs when all the tasks finish.

### **Non-Blocking Behavior:**
- This version does not block the main thread while waiting for the results. Even the result collection is **non-blocking**.
- As soon as each task finishes, the result is collected in a callback without blocking the program.

---

### **Key Points to Understand Blocking vs Non-Blocking:**
1. **With `Future`:** The task execution happens concurrently, but when we collect results using `future.get()`, it blocks the calling thread. This is where the blocking nature comes in, leading to sequential result collection.
   
2. **With `CompletableFuture`:** Both task execution and result collection are non-blocking. The tasks run concurrently, and even result collection is done asynchronously using callbacks, making it fully non-blocking.

---

### **Which to Use?**
- **Use `Future`** if we are fine with blocking behavior and don't mind sequential result collection after all the tasks are done. It’s simpler but can slow down the system in I/O-intensive or long-running operations.
  
- **Use `CompletableFuture`** if we want full non-blocking behavior for both task execution and result collection. It’s ideal for applications where responsiveness is crucial.
