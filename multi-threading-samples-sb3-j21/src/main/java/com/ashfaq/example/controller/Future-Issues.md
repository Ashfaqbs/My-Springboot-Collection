The use of `Future.get()` in the code **introduces blocking**, which can effectively make our parallel tasks sequential, especially during the result collection phase.

Here's a breakdown:

### **Understanding Futures:**
- `executor.submit()` starts each task asynchronously, which means they can run in parallel.
- However, when we call `future.get()`, it **blocks** until the corresponding task is complete. This blocking happens for each future, so it waits for one task to finish before proceeding to the next `future.get()`.

This means that although we're submitting multiple tasks for parallel execution, the code will still wait for each task sequentially when calling `future.get()`, leading to a loss of the parallel benefit during result collection.

### **Why is it Blocking?**
- `future.get()` waits for the task associated with that `Future` to complete before returning a result.
- While waiting for each task to finish one by one, the blocking nature can cause the overall execution time to be similar to sequential processing.

### **How to Fix:**

If the goal is to wait for all tasks to finish **without blocking** one by one, we can:
1. **Use `invokeAll`:** This method submits a batch of tasks and waits for **all of them** to complete before proceeding.
2. **Use `CompletableFuture`:** This is a more modern and non-blocking approach introduced in Java 8. It allows asynchronous execution and result collection without blocking.

#### **1. Using `invokeAll`:**

`invokeAll()` will wait for all tasks to complete and collect results simultaneously, thus avoiding blocking on individual tasks:

```java
List<Callable<Product>> tasks = new ArrayList<>();
for (Product product : products) {
    tasks.add(() -> {
        // Logic for each product update
        // Similar logic as we have in your code
        return updatedProduct; // Return updated product
    });
}

// This will submit all tasks and wait for all of them to complete
List<Future<Product>> futures = executor.invokeAll(tasks);

// Collect results after all tasks are done
for (Future<Product> future : futures) {
    try {
        Product updatedProduct = future.get(); // No blocking on each task individually
        if (updatedProduct != null) {
            updatedProducts.add(updatedProduct);
        }
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // Handle exceptions for each task
    }
}
```

#### **2. Using `CompletableFuture`:**

With `CompletableFuture`, we can chain tasks and collect results without blocking:

```java
List<CompletableFuture<Product>> futures = products.stream()
    .map(product -> CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
        // Logic for each product update, same as before
        return updatedProduct; // Return updated product
    }, executor)) // Runs asynchronously
    .collect(Collectors.toList());

// Combine all futures and wait for all tasks to complete
List<Product> updatedProducts = futures.stream()
    .map(CompletableFuture::join) // Waits for each task but doesn't block sequentially
    .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

### **Summary:**
- **Yes,** calling `future.get()` in a loop causes **sequential blocking**, even though tasks are submitted in parallel.
- To avoid this, use alternatives like `invokeAll()` or `CompletableFuture` to manage asynchronous tasks and results more efficiently.




The **blocking vs non-blocking** part and how it relates to `Future` and `CompletableFuture`,the implementation examples for both approaches using the first function.

### **Blocking vs Non-Blocking Explained:**

- **Blocking:**
  When we call `Future.get()`, it *blocks* the thread until the result is available. This means the thread will be idle, waiting for the task to complete before it proceeds to the next one. This is why `Future` can make things sequential if used improperly — while tasks might be executed concurrently, the result collection happens in a blocking way.

- **Non-Blocking:**
  With `CompletableFuture`, when we call `thenApply()` or `thenAccept()`, it doesn't block the current thread. Instead, it attaches a callback function that will execute **only** when the result is available. This makes the whole operation non-blocking, allowing the program to continue running other tasks while the background task is processing.

### **1. Future-based Implementation (Blocking)**

```java
public List<Boolean> updateProductsWithFuture(List<Product> products) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException {
    ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5); // Create a thread pool
    List<Future<Boolean>> futures = new ArrayList<>(); // To collect the futures
    
    // For each product, submit the task to update
    for (Product product : products) {
        Future<Boolean> future = executor.submit(() -> updateProductWithValidation(product));
        futures.add(future); // Add future to the list
    }

    // Collect the results in a blocking way
    List<Boolean> results = new ArrayList<>();
    for (Future<Boolean> future : futures) {
        Boolean result = future.get(); // This will block until the result is available
        results.add(result); // Collect the result
    }

    executor.shutdown(); // Shutdown the executor
    return results; // Return the list of boolean results (true/false for each update)
}
```

### **Explanation:**
- Here, we are submitting tasks to an executor that runs in parallel.
- But when we call `future.get()`, it blocks the execution until the result is available. Even if the tasks are running concurrently, the collection of results becomes **sequential** because each `.get()` is a blocking call.

### **Blocking Behavior:**
- Let’s say we have 20 products. Even though all 20 tasks may be submitted in parallel, the **result collection** will wait for each task to complete, one after the other.

---

### **2. CompletableFuture-based Implementation (Non-blocking)**

```java
public CompletableFuture<List<Boolean>> updateProductsWithCompletableFuture(List<Product> products) {
    List<CompletableFuture<Boolean>> futures = products.stream()
            .map(product -> CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> updateProductWithValidation(product)))
            .collect(Collectors.toList());

    // Non-blocking way to collect the results
    return CompletableFuture.allOf(futures.toArray(new CompletableFuture[0]))
            .thenApply(v -> futures.stream()
                    .map(CompletableFuture::join) // Join is non-blocking
                    .collect(Collectors.toList())
            );
}
```

### **Explanation:**
- We are using `CompletableFuture.supplyAsync()` to submit the tasks asynchronously.
- `CompletableFuture.allOf()` is a non-blocking way to wait for all the tasks to complete.
- Unlike `future.get()`, which is blocking, `CompletableFuture.join()` is non-blocking because it attaches the collection of results to a callback that runs when all the tasks finish.

### **Non-Blocking Behavior:**
- This version does not block the main thread while waiting for the results. Even the result collection is **non-blocking**.
- As soon as each task finishes, the result is collected in a callback without blocking the program.

---

### **Key Points to Understand Blocking vs Non-Blocking:**
1. **With `Future`:** The task execution happens concurrently, but when we collect results using `future.get()`, it blocks the calling thread. This is where the blocking nature comes in, leading to sequential result collection.
   
2. **With `CompletableFuture`:** Both task execution and result collection are non-blocking. The tasks run concurrently, and even result collection is done asynchronously using callbacks, making it fully non-blocking.

## For the second function that updates the product but **does not return a value**, we are right—`Future` isn't ideal because it expects some kind of return type. However, **`CompletableFuture`** is more flexible because it can handle both return types and `void` operations.

Let’s focus on how to run it asynchronously without returning any value.

---

### **Using `CompletableFuture<Void>` for Asynchronous Operations Without a Return Value:**

In this scenario, we want to perform some operation (updating the product) without needing to return anything. We can use `CompletableFuture.runAsync()` for this, which is ideal for running tasks asynchronously when there’s no return value.

Here’s how we can implement it:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;
import java.util.List;

public class ProductUpdater {

    // This function updates products without returning a value
    public void updateProductWithoutReturn(Product product) {
        validateProduct(product);
        updateNonNullFields(product);
        saveProduct(product);
    }

    // Method to asynchronously process a list of products without returning any value
    public CompletableFuture<Void> updateProductsWithoutReturnAsync(List<Product> products) {
        List<CompletableFuture<Void>> futures = products.stream()
            .map(product -> CompletableFuture.runAsync(() -> updateProductWithoutReturn(product)))
            .toList();

        // Using CompletableFuture.allOf to wait for all tasks to finish
        return CompletableFuture.allOf(futures.toArray(new CompletableFuture[0]));
    }

    // Helper methods (same as in your original function)
    private void validateProduct(Product product) {
        // Validation logic
    }

    private void updateNonNullFields(Product product) {
        // Only update fields that are non-null
    }

    private void saveProduct(Product product) {
        // Save to database
    }
}
```

### **Explanation:**

1. **`CompletableFuture.runAsync()`**:
   - This is used when we don’t expect a result. It will run the `updateProductWithoutReturn()` function asynchronously on a separate thread, without blocking the main thread.
   - Since we are dealing with a `void` operation, `runAsync()` is a better fit than `supplyAsync()`, which is used for returning values.

2. **`CompletableFuture.allOf()`**:
   - It waits for all the `CompletableFuture` tasks to finish.
   - We are passing an array of `CompletableFuture<Void>`, and it will complete only when all product update tasks are done.

3. **Asynchronous Behavior**:
   - The updates happen in parallel without waiting for each other.
   - The main thread won’t be blocked while the updates are processed in the background.

### **Why Not Use `Future`?**
- `Future` expects a return type, so if your function doesn’t return a value (`void`), you’d have to return something unnecessary, like `Boolean.TRUE`, just to make it work, which is not efficient.
- `CompletableFuture` is more flexible and allows for both returnable and non-returnable tasks.

### **Key Points**:
- **Non-blocking**: The operation runs in the background, and the main thread continues execution without waiting.
- **Parallelism**: If we pass a list of products, each update happens on a separate thread concurrently.

This approach ensures that the product updates run asynchronously, and we don't need to return any value from the function. Let me know if this works for your use case!
### **Which to Use?**
- **Use `Future`** if we are fine with blocking behavior and don't mind sequential result collection after all the tasks are done. It’s simpler but can slow down the system in I/O-intensive or long-running operations.
  
- **Use `CompletableFuture`** if we want full non-blocking behavior for both task execution and result collection. It’s ideal for applications where responsiveness is crucial.
