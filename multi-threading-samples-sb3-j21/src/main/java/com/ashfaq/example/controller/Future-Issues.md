The use of `Future.get()` in the code **introduces blocking**, which can effectively make our parallel tasks sequential, especially during the result collection phase.

Here's a breakdown:

### **Understanding Futures:**
- `executor.submit()` starts each task asynchronously, which means they can run in parallel.
- However, when you call `future.get()`, it **blocks** until the corresponding task is complete. This blocking happens for each future, so it waits for one task to finish before proceeding to the next `future.get()`.

This means that although we're submitting multiple tasks for parallel execution, the code will still wait for each task sequentially when calling `future.get()`, leading to a loss of the parallel benefit during result collection.

### **Why is it Blocking?**
- `future.get()` waits for the task associated with that `Future` to complete before returning a result.
- While waiting for each task to finish one by one, the blocking nature can cause the overall execution time to be similar to sequential processing.

### **How to Fix:**

If the goal is to wait for all tasks to finish **without blocking** one by one, you can:
1. **Use `invokeAll`:** This method submits a batch of tasks and waits for **all of them** to complete before proceeding.
2. **Use `CompletableFuture`:** This is a more modern and non-blocking approach introduced in Java 8. It allows asynchronous execution and result collection without blocking.

#### **1. Using `invokeAll`:**

`invokeAll()` will wait for all tasks to complete and collect results simultaneously, thus avoiding blocking on individual tasks:

```java
List<Callable<Product>> tasks = new ArrayList<>();
for (Product product : products) {
    tasks.add(() -> {
        // Logic for each product update
        // Similar logic as you have in your code
        return updatedProduct; // Return updated product
    });
}

// This will submit all tasks and wait for all of them to complete
List<Future<Product>> futures = executor.invokeAll(tasks);

// Collect results after all tasks are done
for (Future<Product> future : futures) {
    try {
        Product updatedProduct = future.get(); // No blocking on each task individually
        if (updatedProduct != null) {
            updatedProducts.add(updatedProduct);
        }
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // Handle exceptions for each task
    }
}
```

#### **2. Using `CompletableFuture`:**

With `CompletableFuture`, you can chain tasks and collect results without blocking:

```java
List<CompletableFuture<Product>> futures = products.stream()
    .map(product -> CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
        // Logic for each product update, same as before
        return updatedProduct; // Return updated product
    }, executor)) // Runs asynchronously
    .collect(Collectors.toList());

// Combine all futures and wait for all tasks to complete
List<Product> updatedProducts = futures.stream()
    .map(CompletableFuture::join) // Waits for each task but doesn't block sequentially
    .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

### **Summary:**
- **Yes,** calling `future.get()` in a loop causes **sequential blocking**, even though tasks are submitted in parallel.
- To avoid this, use alternatives like `invokeAll()` or `CompletableFuture` to manage asynchronous tasks and results more efficiently.
